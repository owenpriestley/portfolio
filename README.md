# portfolio

This is the source code for my portfolio - [hosted on owenpriestley.co.uk](http://owenpriestley.co.uk)

Each piece of content is stored in markdown on [mongoDB](https://mlab.com/). Content is [fetched over XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) and rendered using [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jstransformer-markdown-it).

A few bells and whistles courtesy of jQuery.
